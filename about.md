ColorSnapper is a hobby project of two friends from Vienna, Austria --- Andrey Okonetchnikov ([@okonetchnikov](https://twitter.com/okonetchnikov)) and Alexander Danmayer ([@da_dave](https://twitter.com/da_dave)). [Andrey](http://okonet.ru) is a russian front-end developer & UI designer. Alexander is a talented freelance programmer.
 
The original version of ColorSnapper, released in early 2011, was born after trying to find out colors and copy them into CSS using [DigitalColor Meter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalColor_Meter) from Apple. After struggeling with this task, the initial idea of ColorSnapper was born. A few months later, the first version hit the Mac App Store.

But we always wanted to make the experience for developers & designers working with colors even better.
Therefore after some feedback from our users (Thank you!) and discussions, we decided to start working on version 2.
 
We put a lot of thought and love into this version, which led to a complete rewrite of the application. ColorSnapper has a shiny new icon, new User Interface but most importantly, it is better and faster at its task!

If you like what we've created, help spread the word and tweet about it or leave a review on the Mac App Store â€“ Thanks again.

Andrey & Alex
