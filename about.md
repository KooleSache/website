ColorSnapper is a hobby project of two friends from Vienna, Austria --- Andrey Okonetchnikov ([@okonetchnikov](https://twitter.com/okonetchnikov)) and Alexander Danmayer ([@da_dave](https://twitter.com/da_dave)). [Andrey](http://okonet.ru) is a russian front-end developer & UI designer. Alexander is a talented freelance programmer.
 
The original version of ColorSnapper, released in 2011, was born after trying to find out colors and copy them into CSS using [DigitalColor Meter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalColor_Meter) from Apple. After struggeling with this task, the initial idea of ColorSnaper was born. A few months later, the first version hit the Mac App Store.

But we always wanted to make the experience for developers & designers working with colors to be even better so, after we got enough feedback from our users (Thank you!) and ourselves, we decided to start working on version 2.
 
We put a lot of thought and love into this version, which is a complete rewrite of the application. It also has a shiny new icon, new User Interface but most importantly, it does it task even better and faster!

If you like what we did, please leave a review on Mac App Store.
